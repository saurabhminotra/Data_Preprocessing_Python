# Python_Classification_Salary_Prediction
Data Pre-processing in Python
The dataset contains classes (expected salary ) for each person. The processed data has a classification for all rows and can be used 
as training to classify unseen profiles on a new dataset ( dataset1_test.csv ).
Step 1 - Load processed data and convert categorical columns into binary and normalize the numerical columns.
Step 2 - Split the data into two parts: train and validation
Step 3 - Calculate F1 score using 3 Machine Learning classification algorithms
Step 4 - Compare Results
Step 5 - Tune the best ML algorithm by changing parameters
Step 6 - Finalize the model
Step 7 - Predict the salary of unseen data dataset1_test.csv
